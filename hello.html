    <h3>Made by Tam (Tyler) Tran</h3>

    <p>San Diego is a waterfront city with top-notch restaurants, beautiful ocean-sprayed vistas, neighborhoods that are steeped in history and culture, and a centrally located urban park. Whether you're spending a few days indulging in the city's myriad of beaches and surf spots, visiting the aquatic attractions SeaWorld San Diego and Mission Bay Aquatic Park, or exploring the inland offerings of the city, San Diego will not disappoint. When eating in San Diego, seafood and Mexican—and sometimes both, as with its famous fish tacos—often take center stage. From food trucks to super casual eateries to bucket-list fine dining, dozens of delicious options dot the city. When the craving for fresh fish served dockside strikes, hit Coasterra, Mitch's Seafood, or Royal Rooster. For unbeatable views of the La Jolla surf coupled with world-class California fare, book a rooftop table at George's on the Cove. If you can't get enough tacos, you really can't go wrong in this town—but for creative, elevated options, head to Puesto (multiple locations) or Lola 55 (downtown). (There's more taco exploration where that came from on this Southern California Taco Tour road trip.)</p>
