## Description

• Hello everyone! This is my portfolio for the course of the MIT xPRO Full-Stack Development certification program, while I also have another portfolio for my UX/UI Design journey here (it's a bit messy for now): https://tamtylertran.com/ <br />
• I will put more projects both from this course and from my other portfolio into here.

## Roadmap of future improvements

• Add more projects from MIT xPRO course <br />
• Add more projects from my UX/UI Design portfolio <br />
• Add "Others/Playground" section for my other projects and fun activities <br />
• Add more fun interactions for other people to explore
