• Hello everyone! This is my portfolio for the course of the MIT xPro Full-Stack Development certification program, while I also have another portfolio for my UX/UI Design journey here (it's a bit messy for now): https://tamtylertran.com/<br>
• I will put more projects both from this course and from my other portfolio into here.<br>
• (Temporary) Roadmap: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Create an index page with clear navigation to go to my projects and other pages such about page and playground <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Add more projects into my portfolio <br> 
• If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you!
